So we made this Spotify App for Music Hack Day. It's a synthesizer-y 
interface with knobs and shit, which provides a sweet mood-based search 
interface to the Echo Nest API. Tracks are then matched across the 
Spotify catalog so you can create nice playlists.

Thanks #musichackday for an awesome weekend.
